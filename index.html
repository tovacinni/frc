        <p>In high school, I dedicated a lot of time to my high school robotics team, FRC Team 955 CV Robotics.</p>
        <p>Around the busiest time, I woke up at 7AM, went to school at 8AM, drove to Albany after school to deliver/pickup parts to/from sponsors, drove back to Corvallis by 5PM to start the team meeting, got home around 10PM~11PM, and then did homework or practiced violin until around 2~4AM.</p>
        <p>On days where we didn't have meetings, I drove to a community college in Albany to fabricate parts for 3~7 hours after school. Sometimes, the instructor I was friends with there would only be available during the day, so I often skipped school to fabricate parts.</p>
        <p>We had official meeting times scheduled from 5PM to 9PM on T,W,R,F and 1PM to 9PM on Sunday. As the leader, I always stayed late for debriefing and shop maintenance.</p>
        <p>It really wasn't healthy both mentally and physically, but on the bright side, I learned a lot and my team and I made some kickass robots to showcase here:</p>
