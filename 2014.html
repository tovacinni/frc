        <p>2014 was a transition year. Our team prior to 2014 barely used CAD, and I got accepted as the CAD/Design Lead just because nobody else knew how to use SolidWorks.</p>
        <p>Needless to say, it was a bumpy year for me. I didn't have any mentors or upperclassmen who I could learn from, so I had to do a lot of researching and struggling on my own to learn and design a whole 120 pound robot all by myself.</p>
